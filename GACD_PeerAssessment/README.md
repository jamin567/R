# Getting and Cleaning Data, Peer Assessment Project

## <u>How To</u>
To repeat the work done in this project:

* 1. Download source data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
* 2. Unzip to your working directory
* 3. Execute the script run_analysis.R from that directory.

## <u>Steps Performed</u>
The bulk of the steps done by the script involve loading the data provided from the source, and tidying this into a single data frame containing just the original data cells of interest, in the desired format.  Only the final major step computes a new result from the tidied data, writing out subject ids, activites, and mean of all measures of interest.

### Tidy Part 1
Get feature names and subset to only those features of mean or std measures

### Tidy Part 2
Get the train and test feature sets and subset only the desired features

### Tidy Part 3
Combine the two datasets into 1

### Tidy Part 4
Attach column names to features

### Tidy Part 5
Read and combine the train and test activity codes

### Tidy Part 6
Get activity labels and attach to activity codes

### Tidy Part 7
Get and combine the train and test subject ids

### Tidy Part 8
Combine and name subjects and activity names

### Tidy Part 9
Combine with measures of interest for finished desired data frame

### Compute New Result
From the set produced for analysis, compute and report means of all measures, grouped by subject_id and by activity.
